					<h5 class = "thing_content_title2">Beaches &amp; Coastal Walks</h5>						
					<p class = "thing_content">Galway has some of the best beaches in the West of Ireland. The closest beach to Galway is in Salthill, a short walk from the city centre along the promenade which starts in The Claddagh area. There are three separate beaches in Salthill which are very popular with visitors and residents during the summer and many of the more resilient locals continue their swimming all year round when the weather is less forgiving. Bellow are a selection of local beaches:</p>									
						<h4 class = "thing_name">Dogs Bay Beach</h4>													
						<figure class = "thing_caption">						
							<img class = "things_images" src = "images/things_beach1.jpg" alt = "Dogs Bay Beach"/>	
							<figcaption><i>Dogs Bay Beach</i></figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p class ="beach">Lying back to back, Dogs Bay and Gurteen Bay are two of the most beautiful beaches in County Galway and probably in the West of Ireland.  They are situated only 2 miles outside the picturesque village of Roundstone in Connemara, Co. Galway. Dogs Bay and Gurteen Bay make up one of the finest stretches of coastline in Connemara, offering uncompromising views of Errisbeg and the surrounding countryside.</p>
						<h4 class = "thing_name">Silver Strand Beach</h4>	
						<figure class = "thing_caption">						
							<img class = "things_images" src = "images/things_beach2.jpg" alt = "Silver Strand Beach"/>	
						    <figcaption><i>Silver Strand Beach</i></figcaption>
						 </figure>	
						<p class ="beach">Silverstrand has a safe, shallow, sandy beach of approximately 0.25km bounded on one side by a cliff and the other by rocks. It is particularly popular with and suitable for young families. It faces directly into Galway Bay giving spectacular views. There is a promenade with parking capacity for about 60 vehicles. It is suitable for swimming at low tide but the beach is largely covered during high tides. It is lifeguarded during the summer months. Only 2 miles from Salthill. </p>								
						<h4 class ="thing_name">Salthill Beach</h4>
						<figure class = "caption">						
							<img class = "things_images" src = "images/things_beach3.jpg" alt = "Salthill Beach"/>	
							<figcaption><i>Salthill Beach</i></figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p class ="beach">The beach at Salthill is actually several small beaches separated by outcrops. Some of the beaches are sandy and some pebbly. It is located in Galway city and overlooking Galway Bay, a Special Area of Conservation. The beach is lifeguarded from mid-May to the end of September from 11 am to 7 pm. Salthill beach has been a blue flag beach and enormously popular in fine weather during the summer.</p>

					<p class = "content">Galway is acclaimed for its youthful vigour, heaving pubs and an arts scene that has spawned multiple festivals and the careers of countless performers, playwrights and puppet masters. But for decades foodies who travelled west could be heard moaning about the absence of anywhere really special to eat as they watched the sun go down on the bay. A few notable exceptions aside, the city used to be relatively barren when it came to eating. But the times they are a-changing and Galway now boasts a Michelin-starred restaurant and several other high-end options that are all about local produce and ingredients. In April, the city drew more than 70,000 people to its third annual food festival. The event’s driving force is JP McMahon, Cava Bodega, and the Michelin-starred Aniar. Pubs in Ireland were traditionally not the place to go for a full meal but over the last 20 years and especially since the smoking ban in 2004, pubs now compete with restaurants for the quality of their food. The standard and type of pub food varies enormously but here is a small <a href = "http://www.galwaycitypubguide.com/">guide</a> to some of the best.</p>

					<p class = "content">There are numerous sporting facilities and events around Galway city. Bearna Golf Club, Galway Golf Club, Cregmore Golf Club and Galway Bay Golf Resort are all situated within 8 kilometres of the city centre. The Galway Lawn Tennis Club has facilities for tennis, squash and badminton spread over 22 courts. Galway City Sportsground has greyhound races every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. It was refurbished by the Irish Greyhound Board, Bord na gCon and the facility is shared with the Connacht rugby team. The professional team for the province, Connacht Rugby, is based in the city. They play in the Pro12 and as of 2014, in the Rugby Challenge Cup. The team plays their home matches at the Galway Sportsgrounds. Two senior amateur rugby union teams in Galway, Galwegians RFC and Galway Corinthians RFC, play in the All-Ireland League. Salthill also has a 25m competitive swimming pool in the Leisureland complex with three competitive swimming clubs. There is also a handball and racketball club and several martial arts clubs throughout the city. There is another 25m pool at NUI, Galway as well as one at Renmore's KingFisher Club. Sailing is also a popular Galway sport, as is rowing in the River Corrib. In motorsport, the Galway International Rally was the first international rally to be run from the Republic of Ireland.</p>

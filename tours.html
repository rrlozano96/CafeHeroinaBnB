Offering a 360-degree perspective view of the famed Chocolate Hills plus the distant blue sea separating Bohol from the island of Cebu, the place has captured the interest of the nature loving tourists.
					10 miles from Carmen’s Chocolate Hills Complex and 1-1/2 hour drive through scenic rice fields, historic towns, coconut and banana groves from Tagbilaran, the resort sits on a five-hectare property situated on a mountain top at the cool mountain town of Sagbayan, Bohol. Compared to the Carmen complex, the resort is more spacious and a whole lot less crowded, with ample parking space for vehicles.</p>

					</figure>					
					<p class = "tour_content">Bohol's claim to fame is unique geological formations of over 1000 cone-shaped hills that change in color depending on the season – the Chocolate Hills. You can view the hills from the Chocolate Hills Complex where there’s a viewing deck with a stunning 360° view of the cone-shaped hills. 
					These giant mounds of chocolate-colored earth on the dry season that turn green during the wet season are known across the world for their enchanting beauty. The hills are spread out on a 50-square kilometer land and vary in size.
					No trip to Bohol is complete without seeing this iconic landmark, which is even featured in the local currency.
					The Chocolate Hills has been declared the country's third National Geological Monument and is considered by many as an Eight Wonder of the World. There are a lot of ways to enjoy a tour in Chocolate Hills. 
					You can appreciate the view on its observation deck, get a picturesque view while riding a bike zipline or enjoying a treetop rope course in the Chocolate Hills Adventure Park, and many more.
					According to local legends, the hills were created by two giants who got into a fight and threw boulders and rocks at each other. The mess they left after their battle is said to eventually lead to the formation of the hills that we know today.
					Another story says that the hills are tears of a heartbroken giant who fell in love with a mortal.
					The third story, quite a funny one, is about a giant carabao that plagued the town and ate all the crops. The townspeople then fed it their spoiled food. When the carabao defecated, they dried up to become the hills. 
					In reality, the Chocolate Hills are conical karst hills that were formed by the uplift of coral deposits combined with rainwater and erosion. It's considered to be an extraordinary example of karst topography and is the main highlight of most Bohol excursions.</p>

						<figcaption><i>Lounge at the Beaches of Panglao Island</i></figcaption>
					</figure>						
					<p class = "content">If you’re the type who loves the beach and islands, Bohol will not disappoint. Bohol is also known for its white-sand beaches, islands, and diving sites that are usually included in Panglao Island tours.

					The island is connected to the main Bohol island by bridges and can be traveled to by land vehicles. This is also where the new airport is located in. 

					The majority of top hotels and resorts in Bohol are situated in Panglao Island. Most tourists who love the sun, sea, and sand stay in this part of the province because of its proximity to pristine beaches and islands.

					Here are some of the beaches you can tour and see in Panglao Island to get your much-needed rest: 

					Alona Beach
					The top beach destination on the island, where most luxury hotels, restaurants, and bars are found. Alona Beach is known for its long stretch of white sand and crystal clear waters.

					Aside from working on your tan and trying out various Alona Beach activities, you can try water activities like parasailing, banana boat, fly fish, and UFO ride.

					Dumaluan Beach
					Considered to be an excellent alternative to the more famous Alona Beach is you want an uncrowded white sand beach with clear waters. A must-see in Dumaluan Beach is its stunning sunset.

					You can also find several resorts and hotels here for a fraction of the price of those in Alona Beach. 

					Bagobo Beach
					It is another uncrowded beach in Panglao Island that is notable for its beautiful white sand lined with towering coconut trees. It's a great spot not just for swimming but for divers and snorkelers as well. 

					Bolod Beach
					This features a massive shoreline that is ideal for families with small kids because of its shallow waters. You can also do a picnic here while enjoying your beach day out. 

					Danao Beach
					Here you can find first-class resorts situated near its beautiful white sand shore and azure waters. It's also known as a great diving spot because of its precious marine life. 

					Doljo Beach
					 It is a 3km long low-key white sand beach. A couple of Panglao Island's top resorts are found here that offers a quiet tropical escape for tourists.

					Momo Beach
					This beach is located in the northern area of Panglao Island that is relatively unknown to tourists. Go here if you want to get away from the crowd but still want a pristine white sand shore with crystal clear waters.</p>

						<figcaption><i>Explore Hinagdanan Cave</i></figcaption>
					</figure>							
					<p class = "tour_content">Hinagdanan Cave excursions are a must-add in any Bohol itinerary. Not only because of its beauty, but it's also easily accessible from the Chocolate Hills and waterfall destinations in the province.

					The Hinagdanan Cave features a pool of clear water at the bottom. You can swim here under the mesmerizing sight of stalactites and stalagmites. 

					The word "hinagdanan" means laddered in Cebuano. This now-famous tourist spot in Bohol is said been accidentally discovered by a farmer who built a ladder to access the cave, thus the name.

					The cave also holds historical significance as it was once used by locals to hide during World War II. 

					During a trip to Panglao Island, only one person at a time can enter the 100-meter long cave. Be careful when traversing the trails as it can get slippery because of the moisture inside the cave.

					Once you get inside, you will be treated to a breathtaking site of a freshwater lagoon that's about 10-12 meters deep.

					The light filters through the nearby cave entrance, filling the whole area with a relaxing and otherworldly glow. It is not like any swim you've had before! Once you're done taking a dip, you can also check out the souvenir shops right outside the cave. </p>

						<figcaption><i>Cruise Along the Loboc River on a Boat or Paddleboard</i></figcaption>
					</figure>							
					<p class = "tour_content">One of Bohol’s most beautiful natural attractions is the Loboc River. This beautiful river is a wonder of nature that has been preserved through the combined efforts of the local authorities and the residents.

					The scenic river that runs through multiple towns in Bohol is framed with lush tropical trees, perfect for winding down in the afternoon after your countryside tour. 

					The most popular activity in the river is the Loboc River Cruise activity, where tourists board a floating restaurant. The boat cruise will drift along the serene 1.5km long river while you feast on a Filipino lunch buffet.

					Guests onboard the boat will be serenaded by a local band until you reach the end of the river at Busay Falls. Here, you will be treated to a spectacular cultural show of song and dance. Feel free to dance with the locals; it will be the highlight of your day! 

					For a different (and more private) experience, you may try a Bohol river cruise and paddleboarding adventure that is fast becoming a hit for those who want to explore the river at your own pace.

					This activity is a great way to take in the beauty of the Loboc River without the crowd. It's also perfect for beginners and non-swimmers. </p>

						<figcaption><i>Spend Time with the Tarsiers</i></figcaption>
					</figure>							
					<p class = "tour_content">Like the Chocolate Hills, the tarsiers and their big eyes are synonymous to Bohol as well. These nocturnal creatures are considered to be the smallest primate in the world.

					They grow to be just 15 centimeters long at most, and they're just so cute! Tarsiers can also be found in other Philippine destinations like Samar, Leyte, and parts of Mindanao. But Bohol is known for its tarsier sanctuary tours that help preserve and raise awareness about these species. 

					If it's your first time in Bohol, don't miss a visit to the Tarsier Conservation Area in Loboc or the Tarsier Sanctuary in Corella. These tarsier sanctuaries allow tourists not just to see these small creatures up close, but also to learn more about them.

					For the complete experience, you can join a Bohol day trip that combines other tourist spots with this. 

					When visiting the tarsiers, remember that they are nocturnal and are asleep during the day. You'll find them perched on branches around the sanctuaries. Make sure to keep the noise down because they're sensitive to sound.

					Taking their photos is fine but keep the flash turned off not to wake them up. Touching them is also a no-no because it will stress them out.  </p>

					<p class = "tour_content">Panglao Island isn't the only tropical beach destination in Bohol. The town of Anda has become a fast emerging tourist spot in the island province as well. Located on the eastern coast of Bohol (around three hours from Tagbilaran City), Anda features a 1.5km-long white sand beach called Anda Beach.

					Anda Beach offers a more relaxing tropical escape compared to Panglao Island's famous Alona Beach. 

					Aside from the beach, the town of Anda also offers other natural attractions like blue cave pools. You can explore these and other beaches in the area with a full-day tour of Anda to make the most of your time. 

					Cabagnow Cave Pool
					This natural cave pool, locally known as Kabagno Cave, has been gaining popularity because of its crystal clear waters that you can plunge into from its opening. The cool waters are around 20-25 feet deep and are popular with cliff divers. 

					Combento Cave Pool
					 Another enchanting natural cave pool not to be missed in Anda, Bohol. It has a more shallow pool with just 4-5 feet deep water. The rock formations of the cave look like a chandelier that's why it's named after the word "kumbento" or convent. </p>

					</figure>							
					<p class = "tour_content">While Bohol already has white sand beaches along its coastline, there are also islands to explore where you can snorkel or dive aside from swimming or sunbathing.

					Joining an island-hopping trip in Panglao is highly recommended when exploring Bohol. Here are some top destinations that you can visit during island-hopping tours in Bohol: 

					Balicasag Island
					A prime diving and snorkeling spot in Bohol because of its precious marine life. Aside from colorful reefs and fishes, you can also spot sea turtles here if you're lucky! Apart from the underwater sights, joining a Balicasag Island tour is worth it as it boasts of a white sand beach that surrounds the whole island where you can lounge in. 

					Pamilacan Island
					This small island is an excellent spot for diving and snorkeling. It's also known for its dolphin-watching activity where you can see different species of dolphins. If you’re lucky, you can also spot whales here, too! 

					Virgin Island
					Also known as Pontod or Pungtud Island, this features a moon-shaped sandbar that fades into the water. It's the perfect island-hopping stop for sunbathing or just swimming.  </p>

					</figure>							
					<p class = "tour_content">You’ve crossed hanging bridges, but have you crossed one made entirely out of bamboo? This well-known hanging bridge often included in a sightseeing trip in Bohol is made of woven bamboo straps and stretches over a gently flowing river.

					The locals know it as Tigbao Hanging Bridge. There's an entrance fee, but you get free access to the tourist spot if you join a sightseeing tour in Bohol as it's mostly included in the itinerary. 

					The Tigbao Hanging Bridge is located in Sevilla, Bohol. It's suspended 83 feet above the Loboc River and is the primary connection between two barangays in the town.

					Crossing it might scare you at first, especially if you have a fear of heights. But fear not! It's safe and a unique way to get a whole perspective of the Loboc River.

					To ease your mind about its structural integrity, the bridge has a set of cables that ensure its stability. Your reward for braving the heights and the wobbling? A souvenir shop at the other end.

					It's pretty touristy, but hey, at least there's something! Whether you're a local finding new things to do, or you're a tourist wanting to experience everything extraordinary in Bohol, this is a must-add in your to-do list. </p>

						<figcaption><i>Get Enchanted by a Man-Made Forest</i></figcaption>
					</figure>							
					<p class = "tour_content">Visit one of the most enchanting places in Bohol, which is the Bilar Man-Made Forest. It's part of the reforestation project started in 1947 and launched in 1953 by Governor Conrado Marapao. It was to stop the Loboc watershed deforestation.

					It was a successful project as many laborers, government employees, locals, and even students help each other in the plant seedlings. It consists of 20,000 hectares in the towns of Loboc, Batuan, Carmen, Valencia, Jagna, Sierra Bullones, and more.

					The Bilar Man-Made Forest often included in a Bohol sightseeing escapade is great for a slow walk down a natural tunnel formed by the canopies of well-spaced trees. It's a tranquil place, so it's great if you're looking for a short pit stop before your next Bohol adventure, the forest is just north of it.

					It has a stretch of two kilometers and is made with white and red mahogany trees. This tourist destination is often packaged with other tourist spots such as Chocolate Hills in a guided sightseeing excursion in Bohol.

					It’s also combined with nearby attractions such as this sightseeing tour with Loboc River Cruise. </p>
